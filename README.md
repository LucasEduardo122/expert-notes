This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses:

[`tailiwndcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) to page styling.
[`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) to the site icons.
[`sooner`](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) to toaster component.
[`radix`](https://www.radix-ui.com/) to dialog component.
[`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) to manipulate dates in JavaScript.
